# DSA-Individual-Project-Assignment

In this semester project, students are expected to use the data structures (lists, stacks,
arrays, queues, trees, sets, maps, hashmaps, hash tables, and graphs) to implement
the application described below. Students are also expected to use appropriate
searching and sorting algorithms or techniques to search through the database for
specific items and sort some items in alphabetical order.

Tasks
Create an inventory management system for a provision store that allows the store
owner to add goods, view vendors, view goods, view bills, issued goods and view
issued goods, as shown in Figure 1. You are at liberty to include any other functionality
in your application for extra points.

Item Category
Here are some of the categories that are useful in the store.
1. Beverages – coffee/tea, juice, soda
2. Bread/Bakery – sandwich loaves, dinner rolls, tortillas, bagels
3. Canned/Jarred Goods – vegetables, spaghetti sauce, ketchup
4. Dairy Products – cheeses, eggs, milk, yoghurt, butter
5. Dry/Baking Goods – cereals, flour, sugar, pasta, mixes
6. Frozen Products – waffles, vegetables, individual meals, ice cream
7. Meat – lunch meat, poultry, beef, pork
8. Farm Produce – fruits, vegetables
9. Home Cleaners – all-purpose, laundry detergent, dishwashing
liquid/detergent
10.Paper Goods – paper towels, toilet paper, aluminium foil, sandwich bags
11.Home Care – shampoo, soap, hand soap, shaving cream

You should add more items in each category. The above is just a sample.
Data structure implementation
1. Implement stacks when adding and removing items in categories 1 to 4.
2. Implement queues when adding and removing items in categories 5 to 7.
3. Implement lists when adding and removing items in categories 8 to 11.
4. You can use iterators, recursion, stack and queue implementations of the list and
other techniques to best for the issued goods and viewing goods and bills.
5. Use maps to keep track of product sales (note, each time a product is sold, its
product code should be entered into a sales file)
6. Use HashMaps to store information about the vendors
Other Requirements
1. Maintain the balance between too high and too low stock
2. Generate reports to show how the data structure implementation were performed
3. Generate or allow users to view reports as shown in Figure 1.
4. Creativity will attract extra marks
5. Implement searching and sorting algorithms on items in categories 6 to 11
6. Analyze and report on the performance of your algorithm using Big O Notation and
Omega Notation
7. Document all sections of your codes
8. You may design any suitable efficient algorithm to support your implementation
NOTE
Implement in Java
Design a nice and interactive UI
Use MySQL, MSSQL or ORACLE for the backend. Connecting to Microsoft Access is not suitable for this project.
